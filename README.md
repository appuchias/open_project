## How it works

It searches every folder specified in the .env file (find a template [here](template.env)) for the project. If it finds it, it will open Windows terminal (Yes, I'm sorry, but it is what I *have* to use for now), VSCode and the folder itself (in the windows explorer (I'm sorry again))

## Setup

1. Navigate to the desired folder: `cd <path>`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/open_project.git`
1. Navigate into the repo folder: `cd open_project`
1. Run the file: `python main.py`
1. It is highly recommended to add this project or a shortcut to it to your PATH to make it more handy to use (More info in [project_creator](https://github.com/appuchias/project_creator)).
